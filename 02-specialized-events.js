/**
 * Suppose you have some javascript you need to execute whenever the window is a
 * below a certain breakpoint, and some other code you'd like to execute when the
 * window is above that breakpoint. This pattern has us refining the window 'resize'
 * event into two, very specific events, which only fire exactly when the window
 * changes from above to below the set breakpoint (or vice versa). That way, we're
 * we decouple the logic of checking for breakpoint conditions from the actual application
 * behavior we'd like to implement. We keep the definitions of the application behavior and
 * the conditions for the application behavior separate, and give ourselves the capacity
 * to vary them independantly in a fluid way.
